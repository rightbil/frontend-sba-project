    <p>1695 - Charles County divided.  The new Prince George's County includes the area which would become Silver Spring.</p>

    <p>1776 - Montgomery County is created from the southern portion of Frederick County on October 1, 1776. </p>

                <h4>Parks and Recreation</h4>
                <p>Four major creeks run through Silver Spring:
                    from west to east, they are Rock Creek,
                    Sligo
                    Creek,Long Branch, and Northwest Branch.
                    Each is
                    surrounded by parks offering hiking trails,
                    playgrounds,picnic areas, and tennis courts.
                    On weekends,
                    roads are closed in the parks for bicycling
                    and
                    walking.[13]</p>

                <h4>Geography</h4>
                <p>As an unincorporated CDP, Silver Spring's
                    boundaries are not consistently defined. As
                    of
                    the 2010 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau
                    gives
                    Silver Spring a total area of 7.92 square
                    miles
                    (20.5 km2), which is all land; however, the
                    CDP
                    contains some creeks and small ponds. This
                    definition is a 15% reduction from the 9.4
                    square miles (24 km2) used in previous
                    years.</p>
